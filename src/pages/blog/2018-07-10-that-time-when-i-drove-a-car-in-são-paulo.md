"STOOOOOPPPPP!!!!"

"What? Why are you shouting?"

"Aneesh! _Bist du verrückt!_? You were going to get us both killed!! Oh God!"

Anita was obviously over-reacting! Everything was totally OK!

Well, I did drive her SUV into a one-way street. And she was sitting next to me with an injured leg. But so what!? It's not like there was any traffic coming anyway.

In my defence, it wasn't even my fault. When I said I can drive a car, I meant I used to drive our family car sometimes in India. I didn't mean I can drive a SUV in rush-hour São Paulo traffic! I'm used to driving on the left hand side anyway!

Plus, there are rules in São Paulo. There are speed limits. And street signs. So many street signs! And people actually follow them. Oh, I forgot to mention, I don't even have a license to drive a car.

"Aneesh, today please drive carefully. Everything should be perfect! No mistakes, otherwise I will not help you buy the motorcycle."

No mistakes while driving? Yeah, right! There are more chances of Brazil and Argentina ending their football rivalry.

I found it hilarious when people complained about the traffic in São Paulo. Honestly, I had imagined much worse. I didn't find it any bad. Almost everyone followed rules. Almost everyone respected other drivers. It was generally safe and smooth.

Until, I bought a motorcycle. That is when all hell broke loose! The traffic in SP is crazy! It's dangerous! I was riding in fear ALL the time! Suddenly, people stopped following rules. No one respects other people in traffic.

I had a feeling that maybe, the car drivers don't give a single you-know-what about bikers. Ayrton Senna would feel ashamed looking at cars cutting lanes while taking a turn. Riding here, I was more scared than when I experienced an armed-robbery on the Natal beach.

And then, there are Motoboys! Oh, the Motoboys! The world-famous legendary creations of God who race through rush-hour traffic at MotoGP speeds with beach-attire and without fear. Cutting through cars and bikes all the same.

> _If you no longer go for a gap, you are no longer a Motoboy!_

SP is a city of 20 million people. That is 10% of Brazil's population. This city is so huge, it takes 2 hours to cross it north-south on a motorcycle. Unfortunately and not surprisingly, many bikers lose their life in this city every day.

No wonder then, that I hate being called a Motoboy. Do you see me riding around in T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops? Never! I am ATGATT (I use my safety clothes every time I ride). No matter how hot it is, how sweaty and smelly I am, I always go in full riding gear. BTW, that 'smelly' part is obviously a joke, ladies.

Do you see me cutting crazily through traffic? Never! I always ride responsibly and safely. Do you see me on a beaten-up 100cc motorcycle full of 46 stickers and a top-box at the rear? No way! I am on the coolest motorcycle out there in the city! A 2013 model Yamaha XTZ 250. Or as I like to call her, _Valentina_. Yes, Yamaha! I finally return to my faithful brand.

I'm not saying one brand is better than other. But I have always had a bad history with Honda. The first motorcycle, _2007 Honda XR250 Tornado_, had document problems, made worse by lazy officials (in Portuguese, _filho da pu+@ Despachante_). I had some nice trips with this one, so can't complain! BTW, the buyer still owes me US$ 400.

The second motorcycle I bought was a _2008 Honda Tornado_. Within 1 week, the engine head blew up from the inside. To be honest, I was never sure of buying this one. I should have listened more to my instinct. Well, lesson learnt.

Only nice picture before the engine gave up.

Tired of all these problems with Hondas and desperate to start my travel, I made the intelligent decision of buying a reliable motorcycle from a reliable seller. Well, to be honest, Anita forced me to stop being a _Dicke Kopf_ and spend more money.

> _My mom always says, whatever happens, happens for a good reason._

Do I regret spending 2 months just waiting for documents? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I had an amazing time.

Do I regret losing money on my bad decisions? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Money comes and goes.

Do I feel stupid for not doing my research correctly? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I take it as a learning experience.

Most importantly, did I at least learn from my mistakes? As I would find out later in my journey, ABSOLUTELY NOT!
