"Ricky, don't act like a Gringo! Please!"

"What?"

"Don't act like a gringo in front of the guy."

"But what does that even mean?"

"Umm, I mean, don't act stupid. Be more smart when he arrives here"

"Mmmm... Okay?" I said to Janice, still no clue what she meant.

Me and my friend Janice were at a Shopping Mall in Recife, the northeast of Brazil. Waiting for the motorcycle seller to arrive. Why shopping mall? Because it's convenient for both the buyer and seller, I thought at that time. Because in Brazil, it's more secure to do these negotiations in a public place, I would eventually learn.

Brazil is not exactly the safest country on the planet. What I mean to say is, Brazil is, how do I say this without offending anyone, a little dangerous? Like any other country in my experience. You have to pay attention, learn the local customs and way of life. Commonsense stuff mostly. Put your money inside the wallet before going out of the shop. Don't carry too much cash. Prefer to pay with card. Keep a fake wallet with some money and fake cards. Don't use your phone on the streets. Don't drink too much Caipirinha. OK, maybe the last one is irrelevant here.

A quick search for _Most Dangerous Cities in Brazil_ lists shows Recife regularly featuring in top 10, the actual position depending on the link you open from Google. In fact, Brazil has most number of cities in _50 Most Violent Cities of the World_. Honestly, I don't believe in these politically-manipulated lists. The fake propaganda news and media don't bother me.

What bothers me though is the presence of sharks in Recife's ocean, making the beach basically meaningless. What do you do on the beach if you can't swim in the ocean? Except drinking beer, not much..

Whatever. Doesn't matter. None of this matters today. Because today I'm buying a motorcycle. This is what I came to Brazil for, right? Buy a motorcycle in Recife, finish the bureaucratic stuff, pack my bags and start travelling south along the Brazilian beach. Experience the Carnival in Rio in February. Reach Argentina in April to watch MotoGP live. Visit Patagonia, the southernmost part of South America, before winter begins. Travel north along Chile, atleast upto Colombia. My planning was perfect. Nothing could go wrong in my exceptionally well-planned dream trip! NOTHING!

...

**Note to self: If you want to wake up fresh at 10, don't party till 5.**

I did wake up. Eventually. Hungover. Janice woke up after a few phone calls too, then fell asleep again.

We did manage to reach on time to the meeting point. Only to realise my credit card has a limit. Long story short, Janice managed everything for me. And I acted like a gringo, too excited to finally buy a motorcycle. After all, everything was going to plan. Within 2 weeks, I would get the documents, and then I would be a freebird. Soon I would go on my crazy journey, meet people, have adventures, visit exotic destinations and have the best time of my life.

Two months later, I would still be in Recife, waiting for my motorcycle documents. Two more months later, I would have bought two more motorcycles.

Two more months later, I would be in the cheapest hostel at the border of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, finally reflecting on my journey until then and beginning to write. The political situation in Brazil would make it impossible to buy gasoline, and I had no visa for the other two countries.

It's June now, and I just reached Buenos Aires, freezing in the cold and rain. Patagonia and Chile are impossible in this trip. And every time I look at my bank account, reaching Colombia seems more and more like Shakira, a mere fantasy.
