  "This is the price of petrol for foreigners! If you don't pay, I will call the
  police! This is our country, and these are the rules! If you don't like this,
  you can go back to where you came from!" the angry petrol-pump lady told me
  and my Argentinean co-travelers.

"You're from Brazil! A country of millionaires! You must have money to pay this!" a random old guy chipped in.

Needless to say, the very first experience in Bolivia was very bad. Well, neither was the first experience in Argentina good, nor it would be later in Peru. But that was the weather's fault. Bolivia was different.

It was more culture shock than the other South-American countries I had been to. Bolivia hit me harder than the sun reflecting from the Salar's salt crystals, almost blinding us.

> Salar de Uyuni! What can I say about this marvellous place. Nature at its best. Infinite stretch of salt, white ground as far as your eyes can see. It's actually 200km x 200km. It's so empty, I could see the volcano on the other side of Salar, almost 300 km away!

Dejected from having to pay such high price for gasoline, we decided to skip Sucre and Cochabamba, and reach La Paz as soon as possible. 4 straight days of riding later, we learnt how to source Gasoline. Locals helped us sometimes by buying from their ID. Other times, we paid a little extra and bought from a local auto-repair/lubricant shop.

The state-owned YPFB gas stations even have military personal to stop selling any fuel to foreigners. So I bribed the private pump attendants to sell at lower price by using their ID. At some point during my 4 weeks in Bolivia, this process changed from irritating to fun.

The gas jerrycan was as useful as diarrhoea medicament.

In my experience, every village near the highway which has a gas station, has a guy who buys Gasoline at 'local price' and stores in his shop to sell later for a little more money. Further the village from a bigger city, more the price, upto 7 BOB ($ 1)  near Uyuni.

> Me and Mal (Friend. Misguide. Personal Photographer) rode through the Salar, following the numerous tourist-filled SUVs for general direction. Slowly I started realising that this place is maybe THE most amazing place I have ever visited in South America. Actually, not just in South America.

Reaching La Paz, I decided to stay put for a while, take a pause from motorcycle, and explore the city while waiting for Peru visa. It also gave me an opportunity to do some sports, as well as search for riding gear for my friend.

I decided to visit the 16 de Julio open-air street market to try and find some budget options. How hard could it be, right? Just go to the market and ask people where the automotive/motorcycle section is. Turns out, nobody knows, but they give you some directions anyway.

After 3 whole days of traveling in the amazing cable car, roaming around the market like a gringo, finding nothing useful (except unhygienic food), I finally found a store. This is where I figured out something very interesting about Bolivia. Normally, poor countries use 2-wheelers as budget travel option. Bolivian is actually so poor that motorcycles are luxury.

La Paz's biweekly open-air market.

Roaming around the market was also the first time I realised my 'travel privilege'. Seeing the hard-working men and women opening their shops, working hard all day to earn some money, packing up and carrying away all the stuff.

Suddenly, my problems felt first-world problems. All the complaining I did about prices while traveling until then felt useless. The 'struggle' that I had to go through to buy cheaper gasoline somehow seemed fair!
