[Part 1 here.](https://rickypedia.life/blog/2018-06-29-that-time-when-i-was-in-texas-part-1/)


The Argentine peso is falling rapidly compared to Dollar, and everything is becoming more expensive every day. The monthly household bills have doubled in the last 6 months. The government has always taken the wrong economic decision, leaving a once-upon-a-time rich country asking for IMF loan to prevent crisis. Protests happen every day in all major cities of the country.

But the food is amazing! Today, it's the traditional world-famous Parilla, a huge selection of different parts of meat grilled over coal. From rib-eye steak to liver and intestine, everything is present. No part of the animal goes to waste. Accompanied by Wine, of course.  Good to have friends who know what they are ordering. But a _Malbec_ from Mendoza is never bad.

Apart from food, what I love about Argentina is the people. Sergey, another motorcycle fanatic who found me somehow on Instagram, and his girlfriend Emily, spent the whole day showing me their beautiful city, and did their best to answer my never-ending questions. Among the homemade _Milanesa_, the mate at Costanera, and the dinner and beer, conversation regularly shifted between motorcycles and politics. Argentina has a history of Military coups and Political unrest. Thousands of people have gone missing during military rule.

_"Our current government is s#it!! All of them are s#it!! Our government has this habit, they always make the worse economic decisions ever for the country."_

Can't argue with that! In the 3 weeks I spent in Argentina, the value of argentine peso fell from 29 to 32 for 1 Euro. Good for me, because I'm carrying Euros? Not really! Everything is becoming expensive too.

In Cordoba, I met my friend Belen, and she misses her exam preparations to show me the city. The city is crowded with people and churches, and has one of the oldest university of South America. Actually the first ever public university of the world.

Cuteness overload!

And it's in Cordoba that I make a worse economic decision than the government. Instead of Brazil or Bolivia, I decided to get my motorcycle serviced and repaired here in Cordoba. Needless to say, I spent much more than I should have. MUCH MORE!!

I entered Argentina with mixed feelings. Trying to figure out a country so diverse, so complicated, and so huge with the little time and money I had. After 3 weeks, I would leave Argentina, having figured out nothing much, being more confused, but having a great experience of meeting people. And I didn't even mention the North Argentina yet, that's for my next blog.

Actually, if there is one thing I did figure out, is that I would never enjoy meat in any other country ever again! :)
