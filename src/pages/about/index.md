You must be really jobless (like me) to be reading this!
And if you make it till the end of this page, you will waste 5 minutes of your precious life. I will try my best to explain who I am, as honestly as possible. But no promises.

# About me

My name is _Aneesh Mittal_. But my name is also _Ricky_. You can call me whichever you can pronounce right. I am the CEO and Co-founder of Rickypedia.

I studied engineering (everyone in India does that, right?) I am very lazy, but I am also very restless. When I am not sleeping, I am eating. After eating, I like to sleep again. In my sleep I generally dream about eating.

And BTW, if it's not already obvious, I am a motorcycle traveller.

## FAQ

### Where are you from?

I was born in a small city called Bathinda, in Punjab, India. This town is very famous in Bollywood jokes. I was raised in Ludhiana. This town is very famous for nothing.

### What is this Rickypedia bullshit?

I think I am full of knowledge and wisdom. I am like Wikipedia. But my name is Ricky. So Rickypedia. Get it? Wikipedia, Rickypedia.. Did you notice the extremely intelligent wordplay? OK nevermind.

_Ok, seriously, with this blog, I will primarily try to share some experiences from my 1 year solo motorcycle journey in South America. Sometimes I will also share other stories and views, but motorcycle would probably remain the central theme._

### So, you are travelling alone on a motorcycle in South America? Are you crazy?

No, I am not crazy. Trust me, I got checked from a professional. 

### This name of yours, Ricky, you made this up, right? Just to look cool in foreign countries..

MY MOM CHOSE THIS NAME FOR ME EVEN BEFORE I WAS BORN!

### Why are you travelling with motorcycles? You know travelling with Flights and Buses is actually cheaper..

Shut up!

### What will you do after finishing your trip?

I have no idea. Maybe another trip?

### Ricky, how are you? You haven't called since long time.

Mom! I am fine! I don't always have internet!
