You must be really jobless (like me) to be reading this!
And if you make it till the end of this page, you will waste 5 minutes of your precious life. I will try my best to explain who I am, as honestly as possible. But no promises.

# ABOUT ME

My name is _Aneesh Mittal_. But my name is also _Ricky_. You can call me whichever you can pronounce right. I am the CEO and Co-founder of Rickypedia.

I studied engineering (everyone in India does that, right?) I am very lazy, but I am also very restless. When I am not sleeping, I am eating. After eating, I like to sleep again. In my sleep I generally dream about eating.

And BTW, if it's not already obvious, I am a motorcycle traveller.
